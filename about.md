My name is Joely Nelson. I'm currently a student at the University of Washington pursuing a Master’s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering. I love the Pacific Northwest and hope to become a professional data scientist in the greater Seattle area.

I have a strong background in Python, data analysis, and machine learning methods. I’m adaptable and highly motivated to learn new technologies with the ability to juggle multiple projects at once.

## Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science

I was first drawn to computer science by the intersection between mathematical theory and real-world problem solving. No aspect of that intersection has enthralled me more than data science. I decided to pursue computer science to get a strong background in computing and algorithms with the hope of using these skills to solve real world problems. I attended the University of Washington to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and an emphasis in data science and machine learning.

### TA 
I started work as a TA during my junior year of undergrad and have continued into grad school. I work as a TA for non-major Python classes where I try to create a welcoming environment to foster a love of computer science in my students, many of whom had never coded before. I remember how daunting coding for the first time can be, so I want my students to feel as comfortable as possible. I find teaching extremely rewarding and hope that I can continue to teach and mentor in the future.

### Synthetic Biology Research
I am currently participating in computational synthetic biology research in the Carothers Research Group. I fell into this area in 2018. I saw an intro to synthetic biology class being offered. It had advanced math prerequisites (such as differential equations and linear algebra) that luckily I all had. I loved to concept of applying mathematical modeling and data analysis to solve real world biology problems. After talking to the professor, James Carothers, he invited me to work in his lab, where I was mentored by other students and learned more about modeling and analytics. I still work there on 

## Master's Degree

I graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from there in June of 2020. I realized that my lack of a higher degree could be an issue when looking for jobs as a data scientist, many of which require at least a Master's degree. I applied to the BS/MS program at the University of Washington to get more experience in research and teaching, and gain more skills specific to the field of data science. Much to my delight I was accepted! 

I began my master's degree in the Fall of 2020 and plan to graduate with a Master's of Science in Computer Science and Engineering in March 2022.

I have continued my work at the Carothers Research Group and as a TA as a graduate student.

### Internship at Sandia National Laboratories
In the summer of 2021 I had the privilege of working as an R&D intern focused on data science at Sandia’s Center for Cyber Defenders. I joined a team engaged in vulnerability assessment of software. For my summer project, I was asked to research the efficacy of data analytics as a means of expediting software behavior analysis. With minimal direction, I worked with a small team to define, implement, and evaluate multiple techniques. Early results showed that techniques I developed successfully differentiated process and network traces collected under varying conditions, and my subsequent research paved the way for applying these techniques to more complex applications and environments. 


## Next Steps
I am currently planning to graduate from my Master's program in March 2022. I plan to enter the workforce as a professional data scientist. I look forward to the next step in my career!
