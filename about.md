My name is Joely Nelson. I'm currently a student at the University of Washington pursuing a Master’s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering. I love the Pacific Northwest and hope to become a professional data scientist in the greater Seattle area.

I have a strong background in Python, data analysis, and machine learning methods. I’m adaptable and highly motivated to learn new technologies with the ability to juggle multiple projects at once.

## Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science

I was first drawn to computer science by the intersection between mathematical theory and real-world problem solving. No aspect of that intersection has enthralled me more than data science. I decided to pursue computer science to get a strong background in computing and algorithms with the hope of using these skills to solve real world problems. I attended the University of Washington to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and an emphasis in data science and machine learning.

### TA 
I started work as a TA during my junior year of undergrad and have continued into grad school. I work as a TA for non-major Python classes where I try to create a welcoming environment to foster a love of computer science in my students, many of whom had never coded before. I remember how daunting coding for the first time can be, so I want my students to feel as comfortable as possible. I find teaching extremely rewarding and hope that I can continue to teach and mentor in the future.

The classes I have taught for are Intro to Data Science (CSE 180) in the Spring of 2021; Data Programming (CSE 160) during Winter 2019, Autumn 2020, and Winter 2021; and Intermediate Data Programming (CSE 163) during Spring 2019. I have taught and created material to help students effectively learn fundamental data science topics including scientific Python packages, machine learning concepts, and data ethics. I collaborated with the course staff to document and create content for an entirely new Python data science course, the size of which was doubled from 80 to 160 after a successful first quarter. I mentored 2 undergraduate TAs by collaborative planning and co-leading quiz sections.


### Synthetic Biology Research
Since 2019, I have applied my expertise in data science to computational synthetic biology research in the Carothers Research Group in the Molecular Engineering & Sciences Institute at the University of Washington. My work focuses on utilizing machine learning and data analytics to learn more about the rules of CRISPR-based systems for activating gene expression. Starting from experimental data, I designed, developed, and trained custom machine learning models to describe chemical reaction networks of elemental CRISPR systems. I worked with a team to clean, explore, and analyze a large E. coli dataset, to select 25 genes from among over 2,000 candidates, making further experimentation possible. The rules we uncover from these data-driven analyses will allow researchers to select highly effective CRISPR target sites for engineering biological systems.

## Master's Degree

I graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Washington in June of 2020. I realized that my lack of a higher degree could be an issue when looking for jobs as a data scientist, many of which require at least a Master's degree. I applied to the BS/MS program at the University of Washington to get more experience in research and teaching, and gain more skills specific to the field of data science. Much to my delight I was accepted! 

I began my master's degree in the Fall of 2020 and plan to graduate with a Master's of Science in Computer Science and Engineering in March 2022.

I have continued my work at the Carothers Research Group and as a TA as a graduate student.

### Internship at Sandia National Laboratories
In the summer of 2021 I had the privilege of working as an R&D intern focused on data science at Sandia’s Center for Cyber Defenders. I joined a team engaged in vulnerability assessment of software. For my summer project, I was asked to research the efficacy of data analytics as a means of expediting software behavior analysis. With minimal direction, I worked with a small team to define, implement, and evaluate multiple techniques. Early results showed that techniques I developed successfully differentiated process and network traces collected under varying conditions, and my subsequent research paved the way for applying these techniques to more complex applications and environments. 


## Next Steps
I am currently planning to graduate from my Master's program in March 2022. I plan to enter the workforce as a professional data scientist. I look forward to the next step in my career!
