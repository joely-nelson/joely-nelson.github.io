My biggest hobby is sewing. I love using patterns to create clothes and costumes, especially when I can add pockets! It's always a fun experience to go from a bolt of fabric to a completed and functional garment. I especially love to make coats, dresses, and costumes.

Showcased above are some of my favorite projects.



<!-- #### Faux Fur Coat

I made this faux fur coat to keep me warm and cozy during the winter. I used a coat pattern and 3 faux fur throw blankets to put this together. It was my first time working with faux fur, so I learned about the importance of wearing a mask and having a vacuum to deal with all the fur flying while cutting. -->

The Pen and Paper Gaming Association, the PnPGA, is a University of Washington Registered Student Organization that provides a welcoming, inclusive, and fun environment for tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. I was president of the club from 2018-2020 and worked on increasing diversity and inclusion as well as planning fun events and managing the growing club population. 

With over 100 members, our club hosted a meeting every Friday where I introduced games, panels, speakers, and events.

    <i>Leadership Team, July 2019</i>

Since I was in sixth grade in 2009, I have been attending and volunteering at Girl Scout Woodland Park Day Camp, a week long day camp with over 300 girls aged K-6.

I have planned and presented an hour long curriculum for girls of varying ages and skill levels. Over the years content has included science, drama, folklore, Girl Scout history,conservation, health, and first-aid.

In 2018, I created the STEM Volcanoes station, where girls learned about the science behind volcanoes and got to make their own baking soda and vinegar volcanoes. I was assisted by three seventh grade programme aides who were amazing to work with.

In 2019, I mentored a high school senior from who created the “trash” station for her senior project. At this station girls learned all about recycling and composting.

Since 2017, I have been involved with the leadership team, helping plan the program, manage registration, and organize volunteers.
