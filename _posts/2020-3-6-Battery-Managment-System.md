I was heavily involved in developing the software for a simplified battery management system.

My main work on the system was implementing and designing the touch screen functionality and informative display. I also implemented safety interrupts to open contractors based on changing voltage, current. I was also responsible for writing code to use interpolation and lookup tables to calculate state of charge from voltage and temperature.
