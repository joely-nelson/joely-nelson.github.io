The Vaccine Impact Modeling Tool is an interactive modeling tool, given user input, retrieves COVID related data, models pandemic outcomes, and displays them on a global map.

Made as the final project for CSE 482B: Capstone Software Design to Empower Undeserved Populations at the University of Washington.

In December 2020, the FDA issued the first emergency use authorization for the use of COVID-19 vaccines. A natural question that arose was the best way to administer vaccines to reduce severe pandemic outcomes. Although tools exist to display models or up-to-date COVID-19 data, few tools incorporate both. To help with this situation, we designed an interactive modeling tool which, given user input, models pandemic outcomes and displays them on a global map. The Vaccine Modeling Impact Tool allows users to select and adjust target parameters and useful data to visualize. They can view an interactive global map of the modelâ€™s output with more data available on zooming and clicking. We designed the visualization front end, a data scraper to retrieve current COVID-19 data, a model to simulate pandemic outcomes, and a server to handle user requests and data flow. We aimed for our project to be user-friendly enough that someone with only basic public health knowledge could use our tool and could gain useful insights.

My main part in this project was designing a simple model to be used for the visulization, and designing the framework for a model tempelate that other modelers could use to write their own models in Python to be displayed on the map.

For this project we wrote a paper detailing our process. You can download the pdf here: [CSE_482B_Final_Paper_Vaccine_Modeling_Impact_Tool.pdf]({{file name='../documents/CSE_482B_Final_Paper_Vaccine_Modeling_Impact_Tool.pdf'}})
