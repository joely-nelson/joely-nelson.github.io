CRISPRa is a genetic engineering technique that allows for a flexible engineering of metabolic pathways which have applications in medicines, biosensors, and much more. However, there are many unknowns, and much of CRISPRa engineering has been seeing what works with trial-and-error.

In my research in the Carotherâ€™s Group, I have worked on taking a data driven approach to CRISPRa engineering to reduce this trial and error. By using machine learning, embedded system design, and analytics on genetic datasets, I was able to find actionable insights and find areas for further study.
