An interactive web application designed to visualize presidential voting data from prior years, as well as display polling trends from 2020. In this project I was involved in the design, extensive data cleaning, and some of the JavaScript programming.

This application can be viewed at https://uw-cse442-wi20.github.io/FP-prediction-2020/. Please use Google Chrome.
