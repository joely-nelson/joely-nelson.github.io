*By Joely Nelson*

In this game you will play as a museum intern tasked to design a museum to help girls stay interested in STEM, Science Technology Engineering and Math. 

The purpose of this project is to educate people that the discouragement women face when entering STEM fields is entirely cultural. We as society we can help change this.

The game puts you in a position where you can make a difference in a realistic setting, showing that we can all help fix this problem without changing our lives drastically.
