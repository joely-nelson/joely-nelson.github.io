It was proposed that using a blue light to control the induction of molecules in the CRISPRa process could make data collection for CRISPRa experiments easier, less error prone, and more reproducible.

I designed a blue light projector controlled by the Arduino Uno.

I was able to create a simple projector. I had no prior experience with circuits or the Arduino microcontroller, but was able to create this project.

A preliminary experiment found that the blue light has promise in being able to induce the expression of molecules. Further experimentation is needed.
