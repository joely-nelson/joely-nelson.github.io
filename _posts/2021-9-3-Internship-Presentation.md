title: Data Science as a Means to Expedite Software Behavior Analysis

*By Joely Nelson*

In the summer of 2021 I had the privilege of working as an R&D intern focused on data science at Sandiaâ€™s Center for Cyber Defenders. I joined a team engaged in vulnerability assessment of software. For my summer project, I was asked to research the efficacy of data analytics as a means of expediting software behavior analysis. With minimal direction, I worked with a small team to define, implement, and evaluate multiple techniques. Early results showed that techniques I developed successfully differentiated process and network traces collected under varying conditions, and my subsequent research paved the way for applying these techniques to more complex applications and environments.

**Abstract:** When programs run on a computer system they generate event logs which can be analyzed manually to determine the behavior of the program. However, this analysis requires an experienced analyst and can be tedious and time consuming. This presentation details the research done as part of a summer project at Sandia National Laboratories, where the efficacy of data science and analytical techniques as a means of differentiating program behavior by log data was researched. Early results showed that NLP-based techniques developed; such as n-gram divergence comparisons and UMAP dimension reductionality; successfully differentiate event logs collected under varying conditions, and show promise for applications in more complex applications and environments.
